# Open Grant Proposal

* **Project:** MediaBox
* **Proposer:** [cat4fire](https://github.com/cat4fire)
* **Payment Address:** 17PDx56MLASnEAVbHoQDsS5x3ysG5Mc1fX 

## Project Description :page_facing_up: 

MediaBox is a marketplace for content creators, musicians particularly, to sell content, usually in limited quantities, directly to fans. The scarcity of the content is guaranteed by blockchain technology. Since the supply of the content is hard capped to a limited copies, there is a second hand market where each of the copies can be resold to other fans at the price agreed between the buyer and seller in private. It protects the right of the music to be avoid downloading and sharing for free. 

In MediaBox, every music is copyright protected by UDAP’s Proxy Re-Encryption(PRE) modules. PRE schemes are cryptosystems which allow third parties to alter a cipher content which has been encrypted for one party, so that it may be decrypted by another. PRE ensures that nobody can download a music for free, and the shared music can’t be shared to any other parties. You can also share the bought music to your friend but you can’t listen the music during that time.

MediaBox allows musicians sell their own limited-edition music in the marketplace, users can buy and resell the music to other users too, allows the music to be priced right with the marketed value. Musician can enjoy the 20% of the resell price automatically. MediaBox starts from music first, and it can spread to other media types, like pictures, movies, and online novels, etc. 

The project includes the application on mobile phone, the blockchain side project which we will build on Polkadot, the desktop application on Windows for musician to upload and admin their music. Here are some screenshots:

We'll soon finished the alpha version on Ethereum and partnered with China Music Association which will provide us large amount of different music. We will bring millions of transactions on Polkadot, that’ll help Polkadot ecosystem grow fast.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign: 
1.	We partnered with China Music Association, which will offer us the songs, instruments, so we will have large amount of music when we do final launch. Even that version is different with the one we want to build on Polkadot(The one with CMA is based on Ethereum cloned chain), but we all know that it will help us a lot to have large number of music and musicians in the very beginning.

3. Current Android version of MediaBox
Please download the test version of MediaBox on Android here(https://drive.google.com/open?id=12Z8RapWalVASMndRNr7yhCeRyyVgpui9). This build is only for trial use only, it has limited functions, but it demonstrates the major functions of the music marketplace.
- It includes the marketplace, friends, users activities, musician to sign a music, 
- You can create an account using 12 Mnemonic word, create an password to sell, buy, play, resell music.
- The musician can tokenize the music(NFT) for limited number of copies to sell, the musician can commit the users purchase, send text message to the buyers together with the music.
- Functions you can NOT do: 
a)	we disabled the payment, you can not purchase tokens to buy music. However, we have a test account for you to try.
b)	We didn’t finish the admin software on desktop for musician to upload music and tokenize the music yet, we will send it out early next week.
- The test account you can use, it has token to purchase music. However, all music should be manually signed by each musician, so the user has to wait for the musician to sign and release the music. We will create another test account for the musician early next week, so you know how musician manage the process.
